<h2>hi coder😉🙏 --->  Railway Time Converter (Java)</h2>

This repository contains a Java program for converting standard time to railway time format.

## Overview

Railway time format, also known as "railroad time" or "train time," is a timekeeping convention used in the railroad industry. Unlike standard time (e.g., 12-hour or 24-hour clock), railway time uses a single continuous count of hours, eliminating the need for "AM" and "PM" designations.
